This is a prototype drivetrain using goBILDA mecanum wheels on a custom 4 bar suspension linkage.
The wheel is powered through a series of 3 HTD5 belts running to a shaft which connects to the motor via a bevel gear.
The whole wheel is countersprung using rubber bands and acts as a cantilevered suspension mechanism driving from either direction.
